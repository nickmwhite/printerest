<h1>Team</h1>

<p>The "team" is comprised of exactly one person.</p>

<p>I'm sure you're dying to know: "Why only one person?"</p>

<p>Good question. There are a couple of reasons:</p>
<ol>This project isn't particularly interesting.</ol>
<ol>This project is small. A decent engineer could easily do it in a day. It is taking this noob a month.</ol>
<ol>This project is self serving. The "team" is using this to learn Ruby on Rails.</ol>
